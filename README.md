Day 2, August 8, 2021 Tuesday
Progress: Continued the JavaScript Project Ideas. It was challenging to deal with timers. SO suggests other ways by converting the numbers to ms first then dividing them which sounds easy but I just don't understand it.

Learning: How to square a number using Math.pow() method and create logic for timers.
